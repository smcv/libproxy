libproxy (0.2.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stop building the webkit plugin for now, we have a circular build-
    dependency with webkit. Instead, build the mozjs one, so that we can
    still read PAC files.

libproxy (0.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/50_px-wpad-fallback-env-var.patch:
    - Fix logic to not bypass the config plugin when the env variable
      isn't set. We don't do wpad fallback if the env variable isn't set,
      but there's not reason to ignore the config file if one is provided.
      See https://launchpad.net/bugs/354475.
  * Standards-Version is 3.8.1, no changes needed.
  * debian/copyright: Add copyright note for pacutils.js

libproxy (0.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * Initial release (Closes: #509063).
  * Fix if/else logic and a wrong free in 50_px-wpad-fallback-env-var.

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Set libproxy-dev Arch: any; too small win to warrant installability issues
    on slow arches.
  * Drop shlibs:Depends from python-libproxy as it's Arch: all.
  * Drop gnome-get-source.mk include as it's not working by default.
  * Rename patch configure_check_for_dbus to 10_configure-check-for-dbus.
  * Run a full autoreconf instead of only autoconf.
    - New patch, 60_am-prog-cc-c-o, makes newer autoconfs happier.
    - New patch, 70_autotools, split autotools generated files here to force
      them to be applied last and avoid timestamp skews issues.
    Thanks SÃ©bastien Bacher and Ubuntu for the above.
  * New patch, 50_px-wpad-fallback-env-var, check PX_WPAD_FALLBACK env var to
    decide whether to fall back to wpad:// style autodetection or not,
    defaulting to not fallback when the env var isn't set.
