libproxy (0.2.3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * Initial release (Closes: #509063).

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Set libproxy-dev Arch: any; too small win to warrant installability issues
    on slow arches.
  * Drop shlibs:Depends from python-libproxy as it's Arch: all.
  * Drop gnome-get-source.mk include as it's not working by default.
  * Rename patch configure_check_for_dbus to 10_configure-check-for-dbus.
