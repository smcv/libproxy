libproxy (0.2.3-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * Initial release (Closes: #509063).

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Set libproxy-dev Arch: any; too small win to warrant installability issues
    on slow arches.
  * Drop shlibs:Depends from python-libproxy as it's Arch: all.
  * Drop gnome-get-source.mk include as it's not working by default.
  * Rename patch configure_check_for_dbus to 10_configure-check-for-dbus.
  * Run a full autoreconf instead of only autoconf.
    - New patch, 60_am-prog-cc-c-o, makes newer autoconfs happier.
    - New patch, 70_autotools, split autotools generated files here to force
      them to be applied last and avoid timestamp skews issues.
    Thanks SÃ©bastien Bacher and Ubuntu for the above.
  * New patch, 50_px-wpad-fallback-env-var, check PX_WPAD_FALLBACK env var to
    decide whether to fall back to wpad:// style autodetection or not,
    defaulting to not fallback when the env var isn't set.

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * Fix if/else logic in and a wrong free in 50_px-wpad-fallback-env-var.
